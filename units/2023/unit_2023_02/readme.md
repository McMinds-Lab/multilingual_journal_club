Write a short review of the following article in your target language: Lesser et al 1997

Aim for a half-page summary of the article, targeted to the public. You have the freedom to do more than this, such as long-form reporting or even creating multiple versions for different purposes, but there will probably be fewer people who will want to collaborate with you and put the time in to critique your work.
