In Cuba at the time of the study there was only 28 known species of marine fungi. 20 of the known fungi are from the northwest region and the other 8 were reported by Enríquez y González. 

The objective of the study was to determine the taxonomy of the marine fungi in six littoral beaches north of Havana. This would be added to the marine fungi collection at the Instituto de Oceanología for future study (Institue of Oceanography). 

They classified the marine fungi into taxonomic level of the species using spore morphology. 

They determined the frequency of the appearance of the species in terms of the number of individual isolates of one species compared to other species. 

They identified 158 isolates and obtained 20 species of marine fungi from 180 samples. Of the 20 species 17 were of the phylum Ascomycota and 3 were "Mitosporic fungi". 

*Corollospora maritima* (27.3%) and *Lindra marinera* (20%) were the most abundant species and were found in all but one of the beaches. 

They say that these results agree with a previous paper (Spatafora *et al*.) that said that the majority of the family Halosphaeriaceae can be found in the intertidal zone. This study does mention that the samples were taken on the intertidal zone or the foreshore. 

The nine species that were new to Cuba were the following: 
*Arenariomyces parvulus*, *Arenariomyces trifurcatus*, *Corollospora harmonicana*, *Corollospora pseudopulchella*, *Corollospora quinqueseptata*, *Lignincola tropica*, *Lindra obtusa*, *Lulworthia fucicola*, and *Lulworthia kniepii*.
