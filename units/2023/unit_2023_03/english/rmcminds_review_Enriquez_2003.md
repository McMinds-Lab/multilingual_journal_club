In this short paper, the authors note that marine fungi are often overlooked, and are not well studied in general. Because their general diversity and distribution were essentially unknown in Cuba, the authors used the methods of the time (2003) to see what fungi existed in the intertidal beaches. They had to grow the fungi after collecting sediment, and then identified them using morphology under a microscope. 

Almost all of the 20 fungi species identified were associated with plant matter, such as leaves of mangroves, seagrasses, or sea grape, or decaying wood. Only one was seen to grow directly on the sandy substrate. Most were ascomycetes. The authors state that these observations are in line with previous, similar studies of marine fungi.

From my perspective in 2023, when I am thinking about fungi growing directly on coral reefs, this is a reminder of how little was known not so long ago (and potentially still) about marine fungi. In this paper they are still focusing on fungi that can be grown in culture, identified morphopologically, and are associated with at least partially terrestrial plants and ecosystems. The diversity we might expect on reefs is likely to be drastically different.
