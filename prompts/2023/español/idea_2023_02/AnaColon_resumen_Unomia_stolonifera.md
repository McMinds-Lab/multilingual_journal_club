Interesting thing to note: instead of writing coral reefs as arrecifes de coral, this paper wrote arrecifes coralinos.

In September of 2022 the ecological evaluation project labelled “Habana sumergida” filmed an image of a soft coral (Octocorallia). This was not a known species for the Cuban specialists until this moment. They consulted what is called “Red de Blanqueamineto” which translates to the “Whitening Network”; and I am assuming based on context that it means coral reef bleaching. This lead to it being believed that the soft coral could be *Unomia stolonifera* which is an invasive species of coral that was first seen in the Caribbean on the coasts of Venezuela in 2014. 

It was found that the morphology of the colony, the polyp pulsing, and the pinnules arrangement were those of *U. stolonifera*. However, it was noted that for a more accurate classification, a DNA study is needed. 

The coral was confined to one section of the reef (23° 10’ 47.4" N and 82° 14’ 39.7"). The coral was extracted from the seafloor with the permission of the Oficina de Regulación y Seguridad Ambiental (ORSA) (Office of Environmental Regulation and Safety).
