# The Multilingual Journal Club

All participants in the club read the same peer-reviewed article every unit (maybe every week?). We then write a summary of the article, targeted to a public audience, in whatever language we are trying to learn and improve. This could be a second language, or could simply be in our primary language as a way to improve our communication skills. It could even include other media such as artistic renderings. Some units may involve alternate writing prompts that are not article reviews.

Participation is hoped to:
1) foster a sense of community
2) provide a forum to discuss the latest science
3) improve our language and communication skills
4) familiarize us with version control and collaboration on GitHub!
____

Note: _if you're not comfortable with GitHub, and learning it on top of language and science is too confusing, feel free to look at the articles, write your reviews, and exchange them with a partner via any means you're comfortable with._
____

Currently, the repo is organized such that every unit has its own top-level, numbered directory. A readme in this directory should point us to the unit's article and/or writing prompt. Writings are organized in sub-directories for each target language. Additional files may be added for summary thoughts from each group, pointing out important concepts that they note based on their corrections and discussion.

Writings should be created in this repository as plain text or markdown format, and other participants should review and edit assigned writings with corrections or improvements to make them more natural or impactful. Pairs or small groups of participants with complementary language skills should meet regularly (again, maybe weekly?) to discuss their writings and edits, and to have the opportunity to improve their spoken language. The entire group may meet on a longer interval such as monthly to continue discussion of favorite articles or language points. 
____

Note: _this repo enables asynchronous participation, as well - just pick a unit, respond to the writing prompt, upload your writing, and maybe create an 'issue' or 'pull request' to alert the group so someone can review and edit it. No real need to participate in discussions, if you don't want._
____

The point of this activity is to offer and accept critique of our language and communication skills. Please do not be afraid to make mistakes, and try not to be offended when critiques are offered! Be friendly, everyone! Also, keep in mind the various purposes of different language styles - 'misuse' of language can sometimes lead to misunderstanding of content, but often, there are arbitrary rules that do not contribute to ambiguity. Try to work together to understand not only what is correct, but why - that will lead to a more solid understanding of language.

## Instructions
Send Ryan a message to get added to the group! 

To submit a writing, simply choose a prompt, navigate in the browser to the target language directory within that unit (e.g. multilingual_journal_club/000_example/english/), click 'add file', then 'create new file', and enter your writing. Click 'commit new file' when you are done. This may automatically prompt you to create a new 'branch' of the repository, which is essentially a copy of it that has proposed changes (like a new file). You may then submit a 'pull request' to ask for permission to merge your changes into the main branch - or, you may choose to have a partner collaborate with you directly on the new branch.

To provide feedback on someone else's work, please directly edit their file by navigating to it in the browser and clicking the pencil-shaped 'edit' button. Your changes will need to be 'committed' in the same way as new-file creation - you will have to commit your changes to a branch other than 'main', and then create a pull request if you want to merge your changes into the main branch.

When creating pull requests, you have the option to 'assign' the request to someone - if you do this, they will get a notification and can review your changes, approve the request, and complete the merge. The main branch will then have the updated version of the writing, and you can use the compare tool to see the differences between the old version and the new one.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes with with version control system on GitHub. The main branch is protected, needing two individuals to agree to a change before it can be made.

Feel free to create new Discussions or Issues if you need help with anything!

_again, if these version-control complications are too confusing, feel free to participate by manually sharing files with a partner for feedback and perhaps just joining in group discussions when they happen_
