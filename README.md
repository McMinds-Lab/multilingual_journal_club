## The Multilingual Journal Club

All participants in the club read the same peer-reviewed article every week. We then write a summary of the article, targeted to a public audience, in whatever language we are trying to learn and improve. This could be a second language, or could simply be in our primary language as a way to improve our communication skills. It could even include other media such as artistic renderings. 

Summaries should be uploaded to this repository as plain text or markdown format, and other participants should review and edit assigned summaries with corrections or improvements to make them more natural or impactful. Pairs or small groups of participants with complementary language skills should meet weekly to discuss their summaries and edits, and to have the opportunity to improve their spoken language. The entire group may meet on a longer interval such as monthly to continue discussion. 

Participation is hoped to:
1) foster a sense of community
2) provide a forum to discuss the latest science
3) improve our language and communication skills
4) get us used to version control etc. with GitHub!

Currently, the repo is organized such that every week has its own top-level, numbered directory. A readme in this directory should point us to the week's article. Summaries are organized in sub-directories for each target language. Additional files may be added for summary thoughts from each group, pointing out important concepts that they note based on their corrections and discussion.

The point of this activity is to offer and accept critique of our language and communication skills. Please do not be afraid to make mistakes, and try not to be offended when critiques are offered! Be friendly, everyone! Also, keep in mind the various purposes of different language styles - 'misuse' of language can sometimes lead to misunderstanding of content, but often, there are arbitrary rules that do not contribute to ambiguity. Try to work together to understand not only what is correct, but why - that will lead to a more solid understanding of language.
