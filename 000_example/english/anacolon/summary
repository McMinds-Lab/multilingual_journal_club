In Cuba at the time of the study there was only 28 known species of fungi. 20 of the known fungi are from the northwest region and the other 8 were reported by Enríquez y González. 

The objective of the study was to determine the taxonomy of the marine fungi in six beaches located on the lateral of Havana. This would be added to the marine fungi collection at the Instituto de Oceanología para posteriores estudios (Institue of Oceanography for posterior studies). 

They classified the marine fungi into taxonomic level of the species, while tending to the morphology of the spores. 

They determined the frequency of the appearance of the species by expressing the number of isolate individuals of one species and the percentage of appearance. 

They identified 158 isolates and obtained 20 species of marine fungi from 180 samples. Of the 20 species 17 were of the phylum Ascomycota and 3 were Monosporic. 

Corollospora maritima (27.3%) and Lindra marinera (20%) were the most abundant species which were found in all but one of the beaches. 

They say that these results agree with a previous paper (Spatafora et.al.) that said that the majority of the family Halosphaeriaceae can be found in the intertidal zone. This study does mention that the samples were taken on the intertidal zone or the foreshore. 

The nine species that were new to Cuba were the following: 
Arenariomyces parvulus, Arenariomyces trifurcatus, Corollospora harmonicana, Corollospora pseudopulchella, Corollospora quinqueseptata, Lignincola tropica, Obtuse Lindra, Lulworthia fucicola, and Lulworthia kniepii.
