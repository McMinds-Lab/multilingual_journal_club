The past tense of the verb 'to lay', as in 'to lay out', is prescriptively spelled 'laid', as in 'laid out'. However, spelling it as 'layed' is a very common 'mistake' in English, even by native speakers. If this 'mistake' is made, readers will understand the writer's meaning perfectly well, but those who are familiar with the prescriptive rules of these words may draw unwanted conclusions about the writer's competence.
